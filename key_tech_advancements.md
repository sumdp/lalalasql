# Technical Improvements in SQL Evaluation System

This document explains the key technical advancements in our improved SQL evaluation system compared to basic evaluation approaches.

## 1. Enhanced SQL Similarity Metrics

### Basic Approach Limitations:
Simple approaches typically use:
- Exact string matching
- Simple token overlap
- Binary correct/incorrect classifications

### Our Enhanced Approach:

#### Component-Based Evaluation
We decompose SQL queries into logical components with appropriate weights:

```python
component_weights = {
    'select': 0.25,  # What columns we're selecting
    'from': 0.25,    # Which tables we're querying
    'where': 0.25,   # Filtering conditions
    'group_by': 0.1, # Grouping
    'order_by': 0.1, # Sorting
    'limit': 0.05    # Result limiting
}
```

This allows partial credit for queries that get some parts right, even if they differ in others.

#### Intelligent Column Matching
We implemented specialized column matching that handles:
- Table prefixes (`table.column` vs `column`)
- Aliases (`col AS alias` vs `col`)
- Function applications (`COUNT(col)` vs `COUNT(*)`)
- Fuzzy matching for similar expressions

```python
def normalize_column(col: str) -> str:
    """Handle table prefixes, AS clauses, and functions"""
    # Strip table prefixes (e.g., "table.column" -> "column")
    if '.' in col and ' ' not in col.split('.')[0]:
        col = col.split('.', 1)[1]

    # Handle AS clauses (e.g., "column AS alias" -> "column")
    if ' as ' in col.lower():
        col = col.lower().split(' as ')[0].strip()

    return col
```

#### Semantic Similarity
We implemented context-aware semantic similarity that considers:
- Token position and importance
- Partial token matches
- Equivalent SQL expressions

```python
def semantic_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:
    """More sophisticated text similarity beyond exact token matching"""
    # Consider token position and partial matches
    matches = 0
    for i, t1 in enumerate(tokens1):
        for j, t2 in enumerate(tokens2):
            # Exact match with position-based weighting
            if t1 == t2:
                position_factor = 1.0 - 0.1 * min(abs(i - j), 5)
                matches += position_factor
            # Partial match for longer tokens
            elif len(t1) > 3 and len(t2) > 3 and (t1 in t2 or t2 in t1):
                matches += 0.7
```

#### SELECT Statement Special Handling
For SELECT clauses, we calculate modified precision and recall:
- Higher weight on recall (getting all required columns)
- Forgiving precision (less penalty for extra columns)
- F1-based scoring that balances these concerns

## 2. Detailed Error Classification

### Basic Approach Limitations:
- Binary correct/incorrect classification
- No diagnosis of specific error types
- Limited actionable insights

### Our Enhanced Approach:

#### Cascading Error Analysis
We identify specific error types in priority order:
1. Table selection errors (highest priority)
2. Column selection errors
3. Join errors
4. Aggregation function errors
5. Condition errors
6. Other errors

This provides a detailed breakdown of error patterns:

```python
def analyze_errors(evaluation_results: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Analyze error patterns in the evaluation results"""
    error_patterns = {
        "wrong_table": 0,
        "wrong_column": 0,
        "missing_join": 0,
        "incorrect_aggregate": 0,
        "incorrect_condition": 0,
        "other": 0
    }
```

The hierarchical approach ensures that each query is categorized by its most fundamental error type.

## 3. Improved Prompt Engineering

### Basic Approach Limitations:
- Generic instructions
- No schema context
- Limited guidance on SQL syntax
- No examples

### Our Enhanced Approach:

#### Schema-Informed Prompting
We provide the full database schema to give complete context:

```
Database schema:
{schema}
```

#### Explicit Guidelines
Clear instructions for specific SQL elements:
```
GUIDELINES:
1. ALWAYS use the correct table and column names as defined in the schema
2. Include explicit JOIN conditions when joining tables
3. Use appropriate table aliases to avoid ambiguous column references
...
```

#### Few-Shot Learning
Multiple representative examples covering different query patterns:
```
EXAMPLES:
[
    "natural_language": "List all teams from California",
    "sql": "SELECT full_name FROM team WHERE state = 'California'",
    "type": "filtering"
],
...
```

#### Structured Approach
Step-by-step methodology for query construction:
```
APPROACH:
1. Identify the type of query...
2. Determine the main tables needed
3. Identify necessary JOIN conditions...
...
```

## 4. Comprehensive Analytics

### Basic Approach Limitations:
- Limited metrics (usually just accuracy)
- No visualization
- No comparison capability
- Limited example analysis

### Our Enhanced Approach:

#### Multi-Dimensional Performance Metrics
We calculate:
- Exact match rates
- High similarity rates (≥80%)
- Performance by query type
- Improvement percentages
- Statistical significance

#### Detailed Comparison Analysis
We identify specific query patterns:
```python
interesting_examples = {
    "major_improvements": [],
    "still_problematic": [],
    "regressions": []
}
```

#### Automated Visualization
We generate multiple visualizations:
- Overall performance comparison
- Performance by query type
- Error type distribution
- Improvement analysis

```python
def generate_visualizations(baseline_results: Dict, improved_results: Dict, comparison: Dict):
    """Generate visualizations for the report"""
    # Overall performance comparison
    # Performance by query type
    # Error type comparison
```

#### Comprehensive CSV Export
Detailed query-by-query analysis with all metrics:
```python
def generate_csv_summary(baseline_results: Dict, improved_results: Dict):
    """Generate a CSV summary comparing baseline and improved results for each query"""
```

## 5. Model Optimization

### Basic Approach Limitations:
- Fixed model selection
- No parameter optimization
- Limited context handling

### Our Enhanced Approach:

#### Optimized Model Parameters
We use Claude 3.7 Sonnet with:
- Zero temperature for consistent output
- Increased max_tokens for complex queries
- Optimized prompt formatting

```python
def query_claude(client: Anthropic, prompt: str, model: str = "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219") -> str:
    response = client.messages.create(
        model=model,
        max_tokens=20000,
        temperature=0,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
```

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### 1. SQL Extraction Robustness

Multiple SQL extraction patterns to handle various response formats:
```python
def extract_sql_from_response(response: str) -> str:
    # Try to find SQL in code blocks
    sql_match = re.search(r"```sql\n(.*?)\n```", response, re.DOTALL)
    if sql_match:
        return sql_match.group(1).strip()

    # Try finding SQL without code blocks
    sql_match = re.search(r"SELECT.*?;", response, re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)
    if sql_match:
        return sql_match.group(0).strip()
```

### 2. Error-Resilient Processing

Graceful handling of edge cases:
- Empty components
- Missing clauses
- Unusual SQL structures

### 3. Integrated Visualization

Automated chart generation for key metrics:
```python
def generate_visualizations(baseline_results: Dict, improved_results: Dict, comparison: Dict):
    """Generate visualizations for the report"""
    # Create output directory if it doesn't exist
    os.makedirs("report_visuals", exist_ok=True)

    # Overall performance comparison
    labels = ['Exact Match', 'High Similarity (≥80%)']
    baseline_scores = [baseline_results["exact_match_rate"], baseline_results["high_similarity_rate"]]
    improved_scores = [improved_results["exact_match_rate"], improved_results["high_similarity_rate"]]
```

## Conclusion

These technical improvements collectively transform a basic evaluation system into a sophisticated analysis platform that:

1. More accurately assesses SQL quality through nuanced similarity metrics
2. Diagnoses specific error patterns to guide improvement efforts
3. Leverages advanced prompt engineering techniques
4. Provides comprehensive analysis and visualization
5. Optimizes model performance for the SQL generation task

The result is a system that not only measures performance more accurately but also provides actionable insights for continuous improvement.
